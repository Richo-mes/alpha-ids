## Project Overview

**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to build a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that helps protect a network by watching and analyzing network traffic to spot and stop security threats. The system will use two main methods: one to detect known threats based on existing patterns, and another to find unusual activity that could indicate new or unknown attacks. It will provide real-time alerts and detailed reports to help network administrators quickly respond to problems. The system will also include an easy-to-use interface and an API for connecting with other security tools, making it flexible and able to grow with the needs of the network.

## Project Modules

### - **Network Traffic Analysis**

**Description**: Involves capturing and examining data packets that travel through a network to understand and monitor network activity. This process includes collecting these packets, parsing them to extract key details such as source and destination information, and organizing the data for further review. The goal is to identify normal network patterns and detect any unusual or suspicious activity that could indicate potential security threats. Once the traffic is analyzed and listed, this organized data is passed on to the Signature-Based Detection And Anomaly-Based Detection, who will use it to look for known threat signatures and identify any potential attacks.


### - **Anomaly-Based Detection**

**Description**: Identifies potential security threats by monitoring network traffic for unusual or unexpected behavior. It works by first establishing a baseline of normal network activity patterns, such as typical traffic volumes and communication behaviors. The system then continuously analyzes incoming data for deviations from this baseline. Unusual patterns or significant deviations are flagged as potential threats. Advanced systems often use machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) to improve detection capabilities, allowing the system to learn from historical data, adapt to evolving network patterns, and better identify complex or subtle anomalies that might not be detected by traditional methods.

### - **Data Collection**

**Description**: Involves gathering network traffic data to analyze and monitor network activity for security purposes. This process includes capturing data packets that are transmitted across the network, which contain information about the source, destination, and content of the communication. The collected data is then organized and stored for further analysis. Effective data collection ensures that all relevant network traffic is captured accurately and comprehensively, providing a detailed view of network behavior. This data serves as the foundation for various detection methods, including anomaly-based approaches, enabling the system to identify and respond to potential security threats.

### - **Alerting And Reporting**

**Description**: Involves notifying network administrators of potential security threats and providing detailed information about these incidents. The alerting system generates real-time notifications when suspicious or abnormal activity is detected, helping administrators quickly respond to potential issues. These alerts are designed to highlight significant events and provide actionable insights for immediate investigation. Additionally, the reporting component compiles and presents detailed summaries of detected threats, including the nature of the attack, affected systems, and any relevant data. Reports help administrators understand the impact of security incidents, track trends over time, and make informed decisions about improving network security.

### - **Frontend And Dashboard**

**Description**: Provides the user interface and visual representation of the network intrusion detection system (NIDS) data, making it easier for administrators to monitor and manage network security. The frontend consists of a user-friendly interface that allows administrators to interact with the system, access key features, and perform tasks like viewing alerts or generating reports. The dashboard presents real-time data and visual insights, such as charts, graphs, and tables, to give an overview of network activity, detected threats, and system performance. This centralized view enables quick and efficient decision-making by displaying critical security information in an organized and intuitive format.

### - **API**

**Description**: Will serve as the backbone of the NIDS, performing the key functions such as processing network traffic, detecting anomalies or threats, and managing alerts. The dashboard will interact with this API to display real-time data, alerts, and reports to the user. The API provides all the necessary functionality to run the NIDS, while the dashboard relies on the API to present the data in a user-friendly way. This setup allows for clean separation of tasks: the API handles the detection and data processing, while the dashboard focuses on displaying the information and interacting with users.

### - **Documentation**

**Description**: The documentation task involves writing clear and concise technical documentation for all components of the NIDS system. This includes detailing how each part of the system functions, how to install and configure the NIDS, as well as providing a user guide for using the system. Additionally, documentation must include developer guides for contributing to the project, troubleshooting steps, and any known limitations or issues. Proper documentation will ensure that future users and developers can easily understand and work with the NIDS.
